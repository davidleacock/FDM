# FDM

Using this repo to explore and play around with Functional Domain Modeling.
This will eventually get fleshed out further in a scalable distributed system

Algebra:
In FP an algebra is used to describe a set of operations, laws and types that form the essence
or semantics of a domain.  This is an interface (or trait) that defines the 
main operations that can be performed on or within that domain, without specifiy *how* these operations
are implemented
